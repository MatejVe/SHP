    "## Elastic Collision between two masses\n",
    "We start by looking into an elastic collision between two masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$.  \n",
    "Two masses move on a periodic ring with positions in $[0, 1)$. This means we are modelling 1-dimensional elastic collisions.  \n",
    "Initial velocities of the masses are $u_1$ and $u_2$, and the velocities after the collision are $v_1$, $v_2$.  \n",
    "Final velocities are found through the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy (with a neat trick of writing down the energy conservation as $M_1 (u_1^2 - v_1^2) = M_2 (v_2^2 - u_2^2)$, the conservation of momentum as $M_1(u_1 - v_1) = M_2(v_2 - u_2)$ and dividing the two equations) and the final result is \n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    v_1 &= \\frac{m1-m2}{m_1+m_2}u_1 + \\frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}u_2 \\\\\n",
    "    v_2 &= \\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}u_1 + \\frac{m_2-m_1}{m_1+m_2}u_2\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "The simulation is conducted in terms of 'events': the next collision is found and that is when the positions and velocities of the particles are updated (as opposed to numerical integrators, we would need them if there were some forces acting on the system)."
