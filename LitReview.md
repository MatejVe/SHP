# Review of papers citing the original paper, and some additional literature

## Papers citing "How efficiently do three pointlike particles sample phase space?, S. G. Cox and G. J. Ackland"

### Calculation of free energies from *ab initio* calculation, G.J. Ackland

- Various methods for evaluating free energies, for equilibrium phases, for reaction pathways and for phase transformations
- Discussion of numerical methods and how to calculate required thermodynamical propertie

### Weak mixing and anomalous kinetics along filamented surfaces, G. M. Zaslavsky and M. Edelman

- Chaotic properties of a particle in a square billiard with a horizontal bar in the middle
- Chaotic dynamics to examine systems whose trajectories are sensitive to small perturbations of the initial conditions, non-zero Lyapunov exponent
- Extension to a family of billiard, particulary for billiards with square-in-square geometry

### Origin of chaos in soft ineractions and signatures of nonergodicity, M. W. Beims, C. Manchein, J. M. Rost

- Emergence of chaotic motions for hard-point like and soft collisions between two particles in a one-dimensional box
- Ergodicity may be achieved in hard-point like collisions for specific mass ratios

### A billiard-theoretic approach to elementary one-dimensional elastic collisions, S. Redner

- Comparison of two particles colliding at the half-line $x>0$ to an infinite wedge - usefulness is in infering the collision history of the two particles from the corresponding billiard trajectory
- It is shown that three elastic particles on an infinite line and three particles on a finite ring correspond to the motion of a billiard ball in an infinite wedge and on a triangular billiard table.

### Gauss map and Lyapunov exponents of interacting particles in a billiard, C. Manchein, M. W. Beims

- Lyapunov exponent of periodic orbits with Lebesgue measure zero from the Gauss map can be used to determine the main qualitative behavior of the LE of a Hamiltonian system
- Hamiltonian system is a one-dimensional box with two particles interacting via a Yukawa potential
- Quite involved, nothing to do with the essence of the main paper

### Simplest piston problem. I. Elastic collisions, P. I. Hurtado and S. Redner

- Study of three particles on a finite interval where two light particles are separated by a heavy "piston".
- Pisto undergoes complex motion that is oscillatory at short time scales, but seemingly chaotic at longer scales

### Relaxation to equilibrium in few-particle adiabatic piston systems, H. Li, D. He, Z. Cao, Y. Zhang, T. Munakata, G. Hu

- Hamiltonian system with few particles and a heavy adiabatic piston is studied
- Coherent oscillation, dissipative oscillation damping and anti-intuition energy transfer of the adiabatic piston are observed

### Analytical probability solution and phase transition of a two-dimensional few-body adiabatic piston system, Hai-Hong Li et al

- The spatial probability distribution of a few-body "adiabatic piston" system in a two-dimensional box is analytically computed in statistical equilibrium state, explicit solution of the probability distribution is obtained

### Analytical solution of space probability distributions of particles in a one-dimensional ring, H. Li, Z. Cao, G. Hu

- Spatial probability distribution of a few particles having nonidentical masses in one-dimensional space with both periodic and fixed boundary conditions are analytically computed in statistical equilibrium states
- 1D N-body system can reach a microcanonical probability distribution in the long-time average whenever $N \geq 3$ and the masses of the particles are not all identical

### Periodic solutions of 3-beads on a ring and right-triangular billiards, D. P. Newton

- When three beads slide on a ring and collide with ellastic collisions, if their velocities are chosen carefully, they undergo periodic motion
- Comparison of this problem to a geometric problem in billiard dynamics in a right-triangle

# Ideas on where to take the project

## Random strings idea

### Google scholar query "two bit random strings" and "elastic collisions and random strings" and similar

- Nothing related to elastic collisions
- Nothing has come up on google either
- To the best of my knowledge this does not seem to be an area that has been researched

## Relativistic periodic collisions

### Google scholar query "periodic ring relativistic collisions" and similar

- Nothing has come up on google either
- Nothing has come up and does not seem to be a researched area
