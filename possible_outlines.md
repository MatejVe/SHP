# Possible outlines

## Generating random strings from particle elastic collissions on a periodic ring

### Introduction

- Introduce the system and link to already established results (triangular billiard problem, importance within statistical physics, mention eliminating correlations, etc)
- Discuss the importance of observing such simple systems as a connection between mechanics and statistical physics
- Exploring the ergodic hypothesis

### Introduce the mechanism of generating random strings

- Explain what is going etc

### Statistical randomness and diehard tests

- Discuss the results of diehard tests on the generated strings
- Can true randomness of the generated strings justify the ergodic hypothesis?
- Can the whole particles history be inducted from a substring of the generated string?
- Can this be connected to the efficiency of sampling the phase space?
- Any other connections to other areas in physics or information theory (find some literature to expand on this)

### Conclusions

---------------------

## Relativistic elastic collisions on a periodic ring

### Introduction

- Introduce the system (same as above really)
- Collision matrices
- Discussion on momentum space
- Essentially a chaotic walk on a hexagonal lattice for certain discretisized phase space
- Main problem is the efficiency of sampling the phase space

### Simulation results

- Essentialy try to prove/find differences for all major results from the original paper

1. Newtonian elastic collisions -> triangular billiard problem (perhaps something similar can be infered for relativistic collisions)
2. Can averaged distance traveled be approximated by a power law: (distance traveled) $\propto$ (number of collisions)$^n$
3. Sample random walks
4. Lyapunov exponents

### Conclusions
